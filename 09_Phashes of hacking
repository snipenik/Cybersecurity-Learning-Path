1. Reconnaissance
• This phase involves gathering information about the target system or organization.
• It includes both passive and active reconnaissance techniques, such as Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT).

2. Scanning
• Ethical hackers use various tools and techniques to identify open ports, services, and vulnerabilities on the target network.
• It includes port scanning, vulnerability scanning, and network mapping.
• Scanning helps create a detailed map of the target network and identify potential entry points.

3. Gaining Access
• This phase involves exploiting the identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the target system or network.

4. Maintaining Access
• Once access is gained, the ethical hacker focuses on maintaining control over the compromised system or network.
• This phase involves activities such as creating backdoors, installing rootkits, Trojans, keyloggers, and RATs.
• The objective is to ensure continued access and gather additional information without being detected.

5. Covering Tracks
• An intelligent hacker clears all evidence so that, at a later point in time, no traces lead back to them.
• In this final phase, the ethical hacker removes evidence to avoid detection, 

Including:
Deleting log files
Clearing system logs
Removing command history

• The purpose is to make it difficult for forensic investigators to determine the extent of the breach and identify the attacker.
