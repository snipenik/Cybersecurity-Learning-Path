IPv4:
Address size: 32-bit
Address format: Decimal (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
Total addresses: ~4.3 billion

IPv6:
Address size: 128-bit
Address format: Hexadecimal (e.g., 2001:db8::1)
Total addresses: ~340 undecillion

NOTE: IPv6 is needed because IPv4 addresses are running out due to the growing number of internet-connected devices
