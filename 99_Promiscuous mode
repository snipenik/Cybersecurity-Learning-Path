Promiscuous mode is a network interface setting where a NIC captures all network packets it sees on the network segment—not only packets addressed to itself.

sudo ifconfig eth0 promisc  {ON} 
sudo ifconfig eth0 -promisc {OFF} 

By default, promiscuous mode is disabled on every major OS for security reasons In Lan level

Promiscuous Mode Example on a Hub Network Scenario:
•	You have several computers (PC1, PC2, PC3) connected to a network hub.
•	A hub sends every packet it receives to all connected devices, no matter who the packet is addressed to.

What Promiscuous Mode Does:
•	When promiscuous mode is enabled on PC3’s network interface:
o	PC3’s NIC accepts all packets sent through the hub, regardless of destination.
o	It forwards every packet it receives up to the operating system.
o	This allows tools like Wireshark to capture all network traffic flowing through the hub.

Why This Matters:
•	Normally, NICs only process packets addressed to their own MAC address.
•	But in promiscuous mode, PC3 sees everything, including packets meant for PC1, PC2, or any other device.
•	This is useful for network monitoring, troubleshooting, or security testing on LANs using hubs.
