1️⃣ Entry Node (Guard Node)
First Tor relay your system connects to
Knows your real IP
Does NOT know destination website

2️⃣ Middle Relay
Passes encrypted traffic between relays
Knows only previous and next node
Adds extra anonymity layer

3️⃣ Exit Node
Last relay before reaching destination
Knows destination website
Does NOT know your real IP
Traffic is decrypted here (if not HTTPS)
