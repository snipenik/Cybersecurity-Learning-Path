1. Bus Topology
•	All devices are connected to a single cable (back bone).
•	Data travels in both directions but can cause collisions.
•	Example: Early Ethernet networks.

2. Star Topology
•	All devices are connected to a central hub or switch.

3. Ring Topology
•	Devices are connected in a circular loop.
•	Data travels in one or both directions.

4. Mesh Topology
•	Every device is connected to every other device.
•	Provides high reliability but is expensive.
•	Example: Military and critical communication networks.

5. Tree (Hierarchical) Topology
•	A combination of star and bus topologies.
•	Used in large organizations.
•	Example: Large corporate networks.

6. Hybrid Topology
•	A hybrid topology is a combination of two or more different topologies (e.g., star + mesh + bus + tree )
