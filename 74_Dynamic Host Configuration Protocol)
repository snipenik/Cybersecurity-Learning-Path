•	DHCP is a network management protocol used to automate the dynamic assignment of IP addresses to devices on a network.

DHCP Work Flow:

Step 1: DHCP Discover
•	A device (e.g., laptop or phone) sends a DHCP Discover message to the network (broadcast).

Step 2: DHCP Offer
•	The DHCP server receives the Discover message and responds with a DHCP Offer message, which includes:
•	Available IP addresses , subnet mask , lease duration etc..

Step 3: DHCP Request
•	The client device receives the offer and sends a DHCP Request message to the server, accepting the offered IP address.

Step 4: DHCP Acknowledgment (ACK)
•	The DHCP server receives the request and responds with a DHCP Acknowledgment message, confirming the IP address assignment
NOTE: After entered the password and connected to the router this  process start ,dhcp server located in router.
