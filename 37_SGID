SGID (Set Group ID):
• SGID allows a file or directory to run or behave with the group ownership of the file/directory, not the user’s default group.
• Only users who are members of that group can execute/access it.
• For others (not in the group), it will not work.

Enable / Disable SGID:
chmod g+s filename or chmod 2750 filename   # enable SGID
chmod g-s filename   # disable SGID

SGID on Executable Files Example :
whereis id
cp /usr/bin/id id2
addgroup group1
chown saijain:group1 id2
usermod -aG group1 user1
chmod 2750 id2
sudo chmod 711 /home/saijain


Switch user and execute:
su user1
./id2
/home/saijain/id2

What happens ?
• user1 can execute id2 only because they are a member of group1.
• The program runs with group1 as the effective group.
• Users not in group1 cannot execute it.

Permission Meaning: 2750
2 → SGID
7 → Owner: rwx
5 → Group: r-x
0 → Others: ---

SGID on Directories Example:
mkdir dir
chmod 2770 dir
cd dir
touch file1
sudo usermod -aG kali user1
su user1
cd /home/saijain/dir
touch file2

Observation:

• file1
Owner: kali
Group: group1

• file2
Owner: user1
Group: group1

👉 Even though different users created the files, both files belong to the same group (group1).
