                                                                               Open system Interconnection model (OSI)

1. Application Layer (Data)
•	This is the topmost layer of the OSI model.
•	It allows software applications to transfer and receive data over the network.
•	It provides user interface services, like web browsing, email, and file transfer.
Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, etc.


2. Presentation Layer(data)
•	This layer is responsible for data formatting and translation.
•	It converts data into a format that can be understood by the receiving device.

Examples of conversions:
Decimal → Binary
ASCII → EBCDIC
Hexadecimal → Binary
Binary → Decimal

•	encryption and decryption data for secure communication.
•	Data compression, decompression  happens here to reduce data size for faster transmission.


3. Session Layer(data)
•	Manages and controls connections (sessions) between devices.
•	Responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections.
•	Supports authentication and authorization to verify users and devices.
•	Example: When you log in to a website, the session layer maintains your session so that you don’t need to log in again on every page.


         
 4. Transport Layer
•	Ensures reliable data transfer between devices.
•	The main purpose of this layer is to allow communication between machines
•	Uses two key protocols:

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) → Connection-oriented, reliable, ensures data arrives correctly (Stateful).

                                 Data call him segments

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) → Connectionless, faster but less reliable (Stateless).

                               Data call him Datagrams 

•	Provides end-to-end communication, error correction, and flow control to prevent network congestion.
          

5. Network Layer (Packets)
•	Determines the best path for data transmission across networks.
•	Routes data between different networks using IP addresses.
•	It ensures logical addressing (IP addresses) and handles packet forwarding.


6. Data Link Layer (Frames)
•	Provides error-free data transfer between two devices on the same network.
•	The main purpose of this layer is to allow communication within a network.
•	Uses MAC addresses for communication.
•	Splits data into frames for transmission.


7. Physical Layer (Bits)
•	The lowest layer responsible for actual data transmission.
•	Data transfers using like cables, switches, fiber optics, and radio  signals.
•	Converts data into electrical, radio, or optical signals.
•	Ensures data transmission happens physically through a medium.


Note on OSI Model :
•	Not every communication follows all 7 layers of the OSI model.
•	The number of layers used depends on the situation, application, and network type.


Example:
•	Direct device communication (e.g., ARP, ICMP) may not require Session, Presentation, or Application layers.
•	Simple data transfer (e.g., TFTP) may not need Session and Presentation layers
