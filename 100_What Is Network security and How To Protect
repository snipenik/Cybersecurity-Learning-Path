Network security is the practice of protecting a network and its data from unauthorized access, attacks, misuse, and disruptions.

🔹 What We Use to Protect a Network ?

🔐 1. Firewalls
Control incoming and outgoing traffic
Block unauthorized access

🛡️ 2. IDS / IPS
IDS detects suspicious activity
IPS detects and blocks attacks

🔑 3. Authentication & Authorization
Strong passwords
MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

🔒 4. Encryption
Protects data in transit and at rest
Protocols: TLS, IPsec, HTTPS

🌐 5. Network Segmentation
Divides network into zones (VLANs)
Limits attack spread

📡 6. VPN (Virtual Private Network)
Secure remote access
Encrypts network traffic
