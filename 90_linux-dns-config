#sudo nano /etc/hosts
•  Local DNS resolver:
Maps hostnames to IP addresses before any DNS query is made.
•  Checked first:
The linux system checks /etc/hosts before querying a DNS server.
4.224.249.75 eduplusnow.com { at end of the file }

Whenever you try to open the site by directly typing eduplusnow.com in the browser's address bar, it automatically redirects to a DishTV-related page.
However, if you search for "eduplusnow" on Google and click the link from the search results, it redirects correctly to the original Eduplusnow website, not the DishTV-related page.

#sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
It is the configuration file that defines the DNS (Domain Name System) servers your system uses to resolve hostnames to IP addresses.
nameserver 1.1.1.1
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 9.9.9.9

How it works:
The system will first try the first DNS server (1.1.1.1).
If the first one fails or times out, it will try the second (8.8.8.8).
If that also fails, it will try the third (9.9.9.9).
