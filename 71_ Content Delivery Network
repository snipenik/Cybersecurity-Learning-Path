A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a network of globally distributed servers that store (cache) and deliver content faster, more securely, and efficiently to users based on their geographic location.
Instead of delivering content from a single origin server, a CDN caches content on multiple edge servers worldwide. When a user requests a website, video, or file:

1. The nearest CDN edge server responds to the request.
2. Cached content is delivered instantly, reducing latency.
3. If the content is not cached, the CDN fetches it from the origin server.

✅ Faster Content Delivery – Reduces latency and speeds up website loading.
✅ Reduced Server Load – Less strain on the origin server, improving performance.
✅ Better Security – Protects against DDoS attacks and malicious bots.
✅ Improved Website Availability – Ensures uptime even during high traffic.
✅ Optimized Bandwidth Usage – Reduces data transfer costs.
