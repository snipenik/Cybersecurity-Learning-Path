POP3 (Post Office Protocol ):
Receive emails from a remote server
 Automatically download them to a local email client
 Delete emails from the server after download

IMAP: 
IMAP stands for Internet Message Access Protocol, and it's used by email clients to access and manage emails stored on a remote mail server.
Unlike POP3, IMAP doesn't download and delete your emails from the server by default — instead, it keeps emails on the server and syncs them across all devices.
Uses 143 (non-encrypted) , 993 (encrypted with SSL/TLS)
