The TCP 3-Way Handshake is the process used to establish a reliable TCP connection between a client and a server before data transfer.

                                                                                 TCP 3-Way Handshake Process :

1️⃣ SYN (Synchronize)
Client sends a SYN packet to the server
Requests to start a connection
Contains initial sequence number

2️⃣ SYN-ACK (Synchronize + Acknowledge)
Server responds with SYN-ACK
Acknowledges client’s SYN
Sends its own sequence number

3️⃣ ACK (Acknowledge)
Client sends ACK to the server
Connection is successfully established
