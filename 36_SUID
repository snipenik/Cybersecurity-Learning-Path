SUID (Set User ID):
• SUID allows an executable file to run with the permissions of the file owner, not the user who executes it.
• Commonly used when a normal user needs to perform a privileged task safely.

Enable / Disable SUID :
chmod u+s filename,chmod 4755 filename  # enable SUID
chmod u-s filename   # disable SUID


Practical Example (Executable File):
whereis cat
cp /usr/bin/cat cat2
chown root:root cat2        # change owner to root (example purpose)
chmod u+s cat2 or chmod 4755 cat2


Now execute the file:
./cat2 /etc/shadow
/home/saijain/cat2 /etc/shadow

• Even when executed by a normal user, the command can read /etc/shadow.
• This happens because the file runs with root privileges.
