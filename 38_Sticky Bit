Sticky Bit
• When the sticky bit is applied to a directory, only the file owner (creator), the directory owner, or root can delete or rename files inside that directory.
• Other users cannot delete files created by someone else, even if they have write permission on the directory.

Enable Sticky Bit on a Directory : chmod 1777 dir

Permission meaning:
1 → Sticky Bit
7 → Owner: rwx
7 → Group: rwx
7 → Others: rwx

Practical Example (Directory) :
mkdir dir
chmod 1777 dir
cd dir
touch file1

su user1
touch file2

su user2
touch file3

su user1
rm file2     # allowed (user1 owns file2)

su user2
rm file3     # allowed (user2 owns file3)

user1 cannot delete file3
user2 cannot delete file2
