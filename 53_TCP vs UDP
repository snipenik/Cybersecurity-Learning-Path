TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are network communication protocols used for transmitting data over the Internet

1.TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

•	Connection-oriented protocol - connection must be established before data is sent.
•	Means that the communicating devices should establish a connection before transmitting data and should close the connection after transmitting the data.
•	TCP is reliable and guarantees the safe delivery of the data to the destination.
•	TCP provides extensive error-checking mechanism in both header and data.
•	TCP is comparatively slower than UDP.
•	Retransmission of lost packets is possible in TCP.
•	If a packet is lost during transmission due to network issues (like congestion, errors, or interference), the protocol used for communication can detect the loss and retransmit the lost packet.
•	TCP 3-way handshake.
•	TCP is used by HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, Telnet.
•	Used in critical applications.


2.UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

•	Connectionless - Data is sent without any prior setup or handshake. Each packet is sent independently.
•	The delivery of the data to the destination cannot be guaranteed in UDP.
•	UDP has no error-checking mechanism.
•	UDP is faster than TCP.
•	There is no retransmission of lost packets.
•	No handshake.
•	UDP is used by DHCP, DNS, SNMP, VoIP, RIP.
•	Used in real-time applications- online games  , video streaming
