Data Flow in Networking
•	The flow of data between two nodes is called data flow.
•	Based on the direction of data movement it can be classified into three types.

1. Simplex
•	Data flows in one direction only.
•	The sender can only send, and the receiver can only receive.
•	Example: TV broadcasting, Radio transmission. 

2. Half-Duplex
•	Data flows in both directions, but one at a time.
•	The sender and receiver take turns communicating.
•	Example: Walkie-talkies, Two-way radios.

3.Full-Duplex
•	Data flows in both directions simultaneously { bi-directional } 
•	Both sender and receiver can send and receive data at the same time.
•	Example: Telephone calls, Video conferencing.
