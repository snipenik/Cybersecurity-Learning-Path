Primary Group
• The default group assigned to a user when the account is created.
• Every user has exactly one primary group.
• New files created by the user are owned by this group by default.
• The primary group is stored in /etc/passwd.

Example: If user user1 has primary group user1, files created by user1 belong to group user1.

Secondary Group
• Additional groups assigned to a user.
• A user can belong to multiple secondary groups.
• Used to give extra permissions without changing the primary group.
• Secondary groups are stored in /etc/group.

Example: User user1 added to sudo, docker, or developers groups.
