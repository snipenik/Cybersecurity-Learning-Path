1. Repeater
Function: Repeater capture weak and strong signals 
If the signal is strong, the repeater simply forwards it without much change.
If the signal is weak, the repeater amplifies it (boost strength )before sending it further.
Example:Captures weak Wi-Fi signals and retransmits them with stronger power.Type: A 2-port device.
Layer: Works at the Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model.

2.Bridge
Function: Operates at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2).
Use Case: Used for interconnecting two LANs that use the same protocol.
Key Feature: Bridges maintain MAC addresses to forward traffic efficiently.

3.Modem
Function: A modem (Modulator-Demodulator) is a network device that converts digital signals into analog signals and vice versa to enable communication over telephone lines, cable, or fiber networks.
Phiscal layer , and some time in data link layer also work


How a Modem Works?

1. Modulation (Digital → Analog)
Converts digital data from a computer into analog signals for transmission over traditional phone or cable lines.

2. Demodulation (Analog → Digital)
Converts received analog signals back into digital data for the computer to understand.


4.Router
A router is a network device that forwards data packets between different networks.
It operates at the Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.
It determines the best path for data to reach its destination using routing tables.

5.Access Point
An Access Point (AP) is a network device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network.
It extends the range of a Wi-Fi network by acting as a bridge between wired and wireless networks.
Works at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
Example: In the office building with 7 floors, a router should be placed on the 4th floor, and access points should be installed on the remaining floors. These access points will connect to the 4th-floor router either wirelessly or via Ethernet, ensuring that devices on all floors will have internet access.
