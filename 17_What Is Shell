Shell :
• A shell is a special user-level program that provides an interface between the user and the operating system.
• It accepts human-readable commands from the user and converts them into instructions that the kernel can understand.


How a Command Works (Step-by-Step) :

1.User types a command
• The user interacts with the shell by typing a command in the terminal.

2.Shell checks command validity
• The shell checks for syntax errors and verifies whether the command is valid.

3.Shell translates the command
• If valid, the shell converts the command into a kernel-understandable form, usually using system calls.

4.Shell sends the request to the kernel
• The translated request is forwarded to the kernel for execution.

5.Kernel executes the command
• The kernel performs the requested operation and returns the result.

6.Terminal displays the output
• The shell receives the result from the kernel and displays it to the user in the terminal.
