What is ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)?
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a network protocol used to map an IP address to a MAC address inside a local network (LAN).

Why ARP is Needed ?
When a device knows the IP address of another device but does not know its MAC address, ARP helps find it so communication can happen.


Working Methood :

1️⃣ ARP Request (Broadcast)

Device A wants to send data to IP: 192.168.1.10

It checks its ARP table

If MAC is not found, it sends an ARP Request

Message: “Who has 192.168.1.10? Tell 192.168.1.5”

This request is sent as a broadcast (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)


2️⃣ ARP Reply (Unicast)

Device B (IP: 192.168.1.10) receives the request

It replies with its MAC address

Reply is unicast (directly to requester)


3️⃣ ARP Table Update

Device A stores the mapping:

192.168.1.10 → AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF

This entry is saved in the ARP cache for some time


4️⃣ Data Transmission

Now Device A sends data frames using the MAC address

Communication continues normally
