1. Active Footprinting
• Involves direct interaction with the target system or network.
• This type of footprinting may alert the target.

Examples: Using network scanning tools such as Nmap and Wireshark
          Sending ping requests to check whether a system is online
          Enumerating services and open ports


2. Passive Footprinting
• Involves collecting information from publicly available sources without directly interacting with the target system.
• This method is stealthy and does not alert the target.

Examples: Searching on Google, social media platforms, and company websites
          Gathering information from WHOIS databases, DNS records, and job postings
          Using Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools such as Shodan and Maltego
