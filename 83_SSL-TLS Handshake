What does it do?
•	Encrypts data between a client and server.
•	Authenticates the server’s identity.
•	Enables secure HTTPS connections.

1.	Client (Browser) sends ClientHello:
o	Proposes TLS version, cipher suites, and random data.

2.	Server responds with ServerHello:
o	Chooses TLS version and cipher suite.
o	Sends its SSL certificate (containing public key).

3.	Client validates the SSL certificate:
o	Checks issuer, expiration, domain name, and certificate chain.
o	Ensures it trusts the Certificate Authority (CA).

4.	Client generates a session key:
o	Encrypts it with the server’s public key from the certificate.

5.	Client sends the encrypted session key to the server.

6.	Server decrypts the session key with its private key.

7.	Both now have the same symmetric session key, used for encrypting data during the session.

8.	Server sends an acknowledgment (Finished message).

9.	Secure encrypted communication begins between client and server


How Communication Works After the Session Key is Shared :
✅ 1. Client → Server
•	The client wants to send secure data to the server.
•	It uses the session key to encrypt the data (e.g., a login form).
•	The server receives the encrypted data and uses the same session key to decrypt it.

✅ 2. Server → Client
•	The server wants to send secure data back (e.g., a web page or response).
•	It uses the same session key to encrypt the response.
•	The client receives the encrypted data and uses the same session key to decrypt it.
