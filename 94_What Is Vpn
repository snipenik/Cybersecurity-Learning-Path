A VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and a remote server, protecting your data while using the internet.

🔹 Why VPN is Used
Privacy – hides your real IP address
Security – encrypts data on public Wi-Fi
Access control – safely access internal networks
